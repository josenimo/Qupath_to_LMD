"""Golden-file harness: prove that a change did not alter the collection output.

This is a characterization test, not a correctness test. It cannot tell you the laser cut
the right tissue — it tells you the bytes are the same as they were before your change.
That is the check that matters for refactors, because a coordinate shifted by a pixel, an
inverted Y flip or a different shape order are all invisible in the running app.

Usage:

    python tools/golden_harness.py check      # compare current output against tools/golden/
    python tools/golden_harness.py capture    # re-bless: overwrite tools/golden/

`check` exits non-zero on any mismatch, so it can gate a commit.

Run `capture` only when output is *meant* to change, and say so in the commit message —
re-blessing silently is how a real regression gets frozen into the reference. Never
hand-edit the files in tools/golden/.

What it does not cover: the UI, the intentional behaviour changes around QC and warnings,
LineString geometries (no demo file has one), and any input shape outside the cases below.
Add cases as the app grows.

The `regions` and `packing` cases are the ones whose bytes depend on GEOS as well as on this
repo: merging regions of a class is a union, and a GEOS upgrade can legitimately reorder the
vertices it returns. `packing` additionally pins numpy's random stream — if it differs on its
own, a recorded seed no longer reproduces its collection, which is a breaking change for
anybody who wrote one into a methods section. If only those cases differ after a dependency
bump, that is what happened: check the geometry is equivalent before re-blessing, and say so in
the commit.
