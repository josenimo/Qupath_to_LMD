"""Collect selected shapes: a set number or area of shapes per replicate, spread over the tissue.

The cell-segmentation route, and the route for annotations up to an amount — the selection does
not care what kind of shape it is choosing. With several slides each slide is selected from on
its own and the amount is split between them (`decisions.md` 075, 077).

Runs before the plate: the replicates and amounts decide how many wells are needed, so they are
settled first (`decisions.md` 068). No fragment, for the same reason as the regions route — a
fragment here would leave the plate and the cut below it showing a stale selection.
